# Data Processing Project

This project demonstrates data cleaning and processing techniques in Python using Pandas on a DataFrame. It consists of two main stages:

- **EDA+Data Cleaning**: Performs an exploratory data analysis and initial data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.
- **Processing**: Further processes the cleaned data to prepare it for analysis or visualization, including feature engineering and transformations.

These scripts are intended to showcase common data preparation techniques for data science projects.
